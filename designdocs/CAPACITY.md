## Context and Scope

What is capacity?
Why are we introducing capacity?
What can you do with capacity

Delegation - sponsorship allows for one to 
Purchasing capacity for tokens.

Weights
1 second = 1_000_000_000_000

Units
1 Mill   = 1,000,000,000,000,000 = 10^18          1,000,000
1 Kilo   = 1,000,000,000,000,000 = 10^15          1,000 unit
1 Unit   = 1,000,000,000,000     = 10^12
1 Milli  = 1,000,000,000         = 10^9



## Goals

What can you do with capacity?
- make transaction
- what kind of trasactions?
- What tokens

- Map Weight to capacity?
- Staking




## Proposal
- handling congestion by increasing decreasin epoch
- congestions in handle with fees in other blockchains
- example where managing congestion with fees does not make sense
- Dual transaction model


## Alternatives and Rationale:

- no capacity
- fees
- queues at a line

Non-Goals
- collator incentivization
- Governance
    - capacity epoch threshold
    - block average
    - weight ration
    - batched message cost
